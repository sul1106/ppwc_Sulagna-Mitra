Q4. Under what circumstances should you employ if-else statements, switch statements, or loops?
What criteria should be evaluated when selecting the appropriate control flow structure

Answer:
1. If-Else Statements
Circumstances: Use if-else statements when you need to evaluate conditions that are not mutually exclusive or when the conditions are complex and involve multiple relational or logical operators.
Criteria:
->When there are a few conditions to check.
->When conditions are not based on a single variable.
->When conditions involve complex expressions.

2. Switch Statements
Circumstances: Use switch statements (or equivalent structures like match in some languages) when you have multiple conditions based on the value of a single variable. This is more common in languages like C, C++, and Java.
Criteria:
->When you have multiple discrete values to check.
->When the conditions are based on a single variable.
->When you want a cleaner and more readable alternative to multiple if-else statements.

3. Loops
Circumstances: Use loops when you need to repeat a block of code multiple times. This can be for a fixed number of iterations (for loop) or until a condition is met (while loop).
Criteria:
->When you need to iterate over a range of values or a collection.
->When you need to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.
->When you need to perform operations on each element of a collection or array.
