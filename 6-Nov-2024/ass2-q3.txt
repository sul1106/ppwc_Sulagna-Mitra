Q3.Describe the functions of break and continue statements within loops. Illustrate their applications in various programming contexts.

Answer:
break Statement
The break statement is used to terminate the execution of the nearest enclosing loop (for, while, or do-while) or switch statement. When a break statement is encountered, the control immediately exits the loop or switch block and continues with the next statement following the loop or switch.

continue Statement
The continue statement is used to skip the remaining code inside the current iteration of the loop and proceed with the next iteration of the loop. In a for loop, it causes the increment/decrement step to be executed, and in a while or do-while loop, it causes the condition to be evaluated again.

Example of continue in a while loop
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 10) {
        if (i == 5) {
            break;
        }
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}

Output:
0
1
2
3
4

Example of break in a while loop
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 10) {
        i++;
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            continue;
        }
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
Output:
1
3
5
