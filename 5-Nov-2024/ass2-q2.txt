Q2.State the purpose of the break statement within a switch case. Can a switch case work without it ?
Explain your choice with an example.

Answer:
The break statement is used to terminate a case in a switch statement. When a break statement is encountered, the control exits the switch block and continues with the next statement following the switch block. Without the break statement, the program will continue to execute the subsequent case statements (fall-through behavior) until a break is encountered or the switch block ends.
Yes, a switch case can work without break, but it will result in fall-through behavior where multiple case statements are executed sequentially until a break is encountered or the switch block ends. This can be useful in certain scenarios but often leads to unintended behavior if not used carefully.

Example:
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int num = 2;

    // Example with break
    printf("Example with break:\n");
    switch (num) {
        case 1:
            printf("Case 1\n");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("Case 2\n");
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("Case 3\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Default case\n");
    }

    O/P:
    Case 2

    // Example without break
    printf("\nExample without break:\n");
    switch (num) {
        case 1:
            printf("Case 1\n");
        case 2:
            printf("Case 2\n");
        case 3:
            printf("Case 3\n");
        default:
            printf("Default case\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

O/P
Case 2
Case 3
Default case
